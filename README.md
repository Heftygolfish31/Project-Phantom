# Project Phantom
A project to build a tool to assist in any recovery attempts of a broken system.

## Purpose

In the eventuality that the system is unable to support itself sustainably, a backup process must be in place to protect it from damage. Recovery personnel should be in place to deal with most incidents, but this secondary system acts as a final net between function and failure should they be inaccesible.
